## These steps add any linux binary and make it executable within datastage

### There are two approaches: Bash Script and Docker Container


#### Bash Script

This script must be run within a CentOS 7 or RHEL 7 machine, which has the OCLI binary for OpenShift access. The Docker Container approach will be preferred once completed to avoid environment mismatch.

#### Docker Container

This approach is under construction and not yet ready.
